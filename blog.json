A lot has changed in the world of social media over the last number of years and the number of social channels has grown tremendously alongside&nbsp;it. But don&#39;t feel overwhelmed just yet, I&#39;ve provided some key points to consider when chosing which social channels are right for your business below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Your Business</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s easy to jump on the bandwagon of getting your business setup on EVERY social channel available. If your competitor is on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, SnapChat and TikTok you should be too right? Think again. No you shouldn&#39;t be on every social media channel available.&nbsp;Before you decide which social networks are right for your company, you should consider the following: What do you want to gain from social media? Does it link in with your company&#39;s goals and objectives? Can social media help you reach those said goals and objectives? If after evaluating the above questions you&#39;ve established that there is a real business need to get on social media - great! Now it&#39;s time to think about your target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Target Audience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One important question to ask yourself is where does your target audience live online? Which social media channel will help you to reach them best? For example,&nbsp;if a local restaurant&#39;s clientelle is predominantly college students, chances are their target audience is more active on Instagram and TikTok as opposed to LinkedIn and will seek information about your company&#39;s product offering there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Channels</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So now you&#39;ve established that your business can benefit from social media and where your target audience live online. With that in mind, select a social channel which ticks both of those boxes with an emphasis on a channel which helps you to showcase your company best. There may be more than one channel&nbsp;and that&#39;s fine. But make sure you if you&#39;re going to use more than one, that you dedicate the time neccessary to setting it up and keeping it up-to-date. There&#39;s nothing worse than stumbling across a company&#39;s social media channel which hasn&#39;t&nbsp;been updated in months!</p>"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "3 Benefits of a Website for Small Businesses", "slug": "3-benefits-of-a-website-for-small-businesses", "blog_image": "", "blog_image_url": null, "heading": "3 Benefits of a Website for Small Businesses", "blog_content": "<p>It has never been more important for businesses to have a strong online presence.
